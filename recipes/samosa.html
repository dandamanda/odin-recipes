 <br>
 <h2>Steps for cooking</h2>
 <h3>Make the filling</h3>
   <ol>
      <li>Heat a frying pan. Dry fry the coriander seeds until fragrant. Cool and pound using a mortar and pestle.</li>
      <li>Heat the palm oil in the frying pan. Saute the onion with the coriander seeds, cumin and ginger powders until the onion bits are softened.</li>
      <li>Add the potato cubes. Cook over high heat until the potato cubes are lightly browned in parts.</li>
      <li>Off the heat, stir in the peas.</li>
      <li>Season the filling with chili flakes, pepper and salt. </li>
      <li>Cool at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
   </ol>
   <h3>Make the shell</h3>
     <ol>
          <li>In a bowl, whisk together the flour, salt and baking powder.</li>
          <li>Cut the shortening into small pieces and add to the flour mixture.</li>
          <li>Using your fingers, rub the shortening with the flour mixture until the texture resembles uncooked oatmeal.</li>
          <li>Pour in the water, a third at a time, while mixing the dough with your hand. </li>
          <li>When all the water has been poured in, gather the dough into a ball and transfer to the work surface. Knead for five minutes until lightly elastic.</li>
          <li>Wrap in cling film and leave to rest at room temperature for at least half an hour.</li>
     </ol>
    <h3>Assemble and fry the samosas</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Unwrap the dough and form into a log. Cut into eight equal portions.</li>
        <li>Using a rolling pin, flatten a portion of the dough into a circle about an eighth of an inch thick.</li>
        <li>Cut the rolled dough into halves and repeat with the rest of the dough.</li>
        <li>Take a piece of dough and shape into a cone.</li> <img src="cone.jpg" alt="Shaping dough into cone" height="1080" width="1080">
        <li>Drop a heaping tablespoon of filling into the shaped dough and pinch the edges to seal (dabbing a little water on the edges makes sealing easier).</li> <img src="close.jpg" alt="Sealing the dough using hands" height="1080" width="1080">
        <li>Cover the uncooked samosas with a damp kitchen towel and allow to rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
      </ol>
    <h3>Deep fry the samosas</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>Heat the palm oil in a wok to 320F.</li>
          <li>Fry the samosas in batches to avoid overcrowding.</li>
          <li>The samosas are done once golden brown in color.</li>
      </ol>
